# Search-Filter Products Project

An application used to search products with your filter, based on your product name you enter in search box or categories placed in top of the app, built with vanila JavaScript, and CSS.

### Installation and Setup Instructions

You need node and npm installed globally on your machine.

Installation:

`npm install -g json-server`

To watch the products recived from json-server:

`json-server --watch db.json`

and if after install you had an error:

`set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope currentUser`

### Reflection

-Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

I wanted to build an application that allowed users to search products with filter, based on product name that enters in search box or categories placed in top of the app.

I used vanilla JS, css and json-server for serve API datas.
